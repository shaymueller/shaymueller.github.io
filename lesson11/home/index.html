            <h3>Hatch and Kendall retire</h3>

                The June school board meeting for the West Side School District ended with a heartfelt thanks to two
                long-term staff who have decided to start enjoying their retirement. <br>

                Allen Hatch began working for West Side in 2004 as the district’s Transportation Supervisor. The safe
                transportation of the students at West Side has always been his primary focus. The board took this
                opportunity to thank him for keeping all the buses in good working order with regular maintenance,
                determining a bus routes safety during winter weather, and so much more.<br>

                Marcia Kendall has worked for West Side School District since 1988. Starting as a cook she worked her
                way up to Food Services Director. She has ensured delicious and nutritious meals to the students and
                staff. Over her more than 30 year time at west side she has maintained a great nutrition policy for the
                students of West Side, kept two separate kitchens running smoothly, kept her department “in the black”
                and the facilities in good repair.<br>

                There were many tears, from both the board and the retirees, when the school board handed them their
                plaque to commemorate their years of exemplary service.<br>
