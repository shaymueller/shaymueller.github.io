      <p class="description">
        Uber's design is minimalistic with maximum contrast in black and white. The black background on the header with
        contrasting button backgrounds keeps the interface interesting and easy to read. The stark contrast makes it
        especially easy to navigate and read on a smart phone as well as a desktop computer.

      <h3 class="principle">Proximity</h3>
      <p class="company">Target</p>

      <p class="description">
        Target's design is wisely grouped into easy to read section. This tells the brain that all the wording which is
        in close proximity is related to each other. The ideas for Mother's Day gifts is all grouped together and the
        brain easily understand that it can click on the button under this title to get ideas. Even the smaller heading
        of where your shopping is easy to see and seperate from the rest of the text because of the proximity between
        the text around it.

      <h3 class="principle">Alignment</h3>
      <p class="company">DoorDash</p>

      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Doordash's design uses alignment to it's advantage to help keep the eye on the page longer. The transition from
        right alignment of the top menu to centered to left alignment helps the eye flow down the page. The different
        alignments helps break up the page into sections that are easy to see and seperate.
